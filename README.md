# hello-world-cpp

## Instructions
Make a simple program in C++ by editing the file main.cpp.  Make sure you test your code by running it.  Then, add, commit, and push your code by following the instructions below.

1. Open up a terminal, command prompt, or Git bash
2. Configure your user name and email to your Github username and email.  Note that you only have to do this once if you're using your personal machine (you need to do this everytime on the K3 machines since they get wiped every day).

  a. `git config user.name "your-username"`
  
  b. `git config user.email "youremail@email.com"`
4. Add your files.  This can be done with `git add --all`
5. Commit your files with a commit message.  A commit message is a little message telling you and other people what you did with the file.  `git commit -m "your commit message"`
6. Push your files with `git push`
